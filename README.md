### Manual Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ChiragAJain/Terms-and-Condition-Summariser-using-NLP
   cd genai-legal-assistant
   ```

2. **Run setup script**
   ```bash
   python setup_local.py
   ```

3. **Configure API key (optional for GenAI features)**
   
   Edit the `.env` file (created automatically) and replace:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
   ```
   
   With your actual API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

4. **Test API connection (optional)**
   ```bash
   python test_gemini.py
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

The application features a mobile-first responsive design that adapts to all screen sizes:

- **Mobile (< 480px)**: Optimized touch interface with stacked layouts
- **Tablet (480px - 768px)**: Balanced layout with improved spacing
- **Desktop (> 768px)**: Full-featured layout with side-by-side elements

## üé® UI Features

- **Modern Design System**: Consistent colors, typography, and spacing
- **Smooth Animations**: Subtle transitions and hover effects

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"ModuleNotFoundError" when running the app:**
- Run `python setup_local.py` to install dependencies
- Make sure you're using Python 3.8 or higher

**GenAI features not working:**
- Run `python test_gemini.py` to test your API connection
- Check that your `.env` file has a valid `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- Make sure the API key is not the placeholder `your-gemini-api-key-here`
- Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
- Verify your API key has access to Gemini models
- The app will fall back to rule-based analysis without a valid API key

**File upload not working:**
- Check that the `static` directory exists (created automatically by setup scripts)
- Ensure file size is under 8MB
- Supported formats: PDF, TXT, DOCX

**Port already in use:**
- Another application might be using port 5000
- Stop other Flask applications or change the port in `app.py`

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

The application uses a `.env` file for configuration (created automatically on first run):

- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Required for GenAI features. Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
- `FLASK_ENV`: Set to `development` for local development
- `FLASK_DEBUG`: Set to `True` for debug mode
- `DATABASE_URL`: SQLite database path (default: `sqlite:///project.db`)

### Operating Modes

The application automatically detects available dependencies and operates in the best available mode:

1. **GenAI Mode**: Full features with Google Gemini AI (requires API key)
2. **AI Mode**: Fallback to Legal Pegasus model (requires ML dependencies)
3. **Lite Mode**: Rule-based analysis (minimal dependencies)
